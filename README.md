# Machine-Learning---Decision-Trees

In this project we tackle the classification problem using decision trees. We work 
on a new auction dataset. This dataset contains real data on 1,292 auctions that transacted on
eBay.com during May-June 2004. Suppose you are leading the analytics team at eBay and are
tasked with predicting what types of auctions are likely to be competitive so that the platform
can allocate more resources (e.g., advertising, supports) towards them. A competitive auction is
defined as an auction with at least two bids placed on the item being auctioned. The data
include information about the item (product category), the seller (number of ratings a seller has
received), and the auction terms set by the seller (auction duration, opening price, whether the
auction closing day is on weekend). You would like to build a decision tree to predict whether
an auction will be competitive or not
